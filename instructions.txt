To complete the CV download setup:

1. Convert your CV layout to a PDF file named "Pasindu_Madushan_CV.pdf"
   - You can use a tool like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or an online PDF converter
   - Make sure the PDF looks exactly like the CV layout you shared

2. Place the PDF file in the "public" directory of your Next.js project
   - This is typically at the root level of your project
   - The path should be: /public/Pasindu_Madushan_CV.pdf

3. Deploy your site again after adding the PDF file

Once these steps are completed, the "Download CV" button will download your exact CV layout as a PDF file.
